# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
This project is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is designed to run on a single web page. It allows a user to play the classic game against the computer. The interface presents three buttons—Rock, Paper, and Scissors—each representing one of the possible choices. When the user clicks one, the JavaScript code randomly selects a choice for the computer and compares both options to determine the outcome.

The logic behind the game follows the traditional rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. If both the user and the computer choose the same option, the result is a tie. After a choice is made, the page dynamically displays the user's choice, the computer’s choice, and the result (win, lose, or tie).

The layout is styled using CSS to make the interface clean and visually appealing. The game is responsive and works in any modern web browser. It’s a beginner-friendly project ideal for understanding basic web development concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and conditional logic.
